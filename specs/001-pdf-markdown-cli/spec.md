# Feature Specification: PDF to Markdown CLI Tool (MVP)

**Feature Branch**: `001-pdf-markdown-cli`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "pdf를 markdown으로 변환하는 cli 도구"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to convert a PDF file to a Markdown file using a command-line interface so that I can get the text content in a simple format.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a PDF file named `document.pdf`, **When** I run the command `pdf-to-markdown document.pdf`, **Then** a new file named `document.md` is created in the same directory.
2. **Given** I provide a non-existent PDF file, **When** I run the command, **Then** the tool shows an error message "File not found".

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the output file `document.md` already exists? The tool should overwrite it.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a command-line interface (CLI).
- **FR-002**: The CLI MUST accept a path to a PDF file as an input argument.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST extract the text content of the input PDF.
