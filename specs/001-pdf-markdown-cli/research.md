# Research for PDF to Markdown CLI Tool

## 1. Language and Framework

*   **Decision**: Python 3
*   **Rationale**: The chosen tool, `markitdown`, is a Python utility, and Python has good support for calling the Gemini API.
*   **Alternatives considered**: N/A

## 2. PDF to Markdown Conversion Library

*   **Decision**: `markitdown` (https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)
*   **Rationale**:
    *   This tool is specifically designed for converting various document formats, including PDF, to Markdown.
    *   It provides a strong baseline for the conversion.
*   **Alternatives considered**:
    *   `pdfminer.six` + custom logic: `markitdown` is a more complete solution.

## 3. Markdown Enhancement

*   **Decision**: Use the Gemini API to refine the Markdown output from `markitdown`.
*   **Rationale**:
    *   `markitdown` may produce a Markdown file that is structurally correct but not very readable.
    *   A large language model like Gemini can be used to "naturalize" the Markdown, improving flow and readability.
    *   This adds significant value to the tool.
*   **Dependencies**: `google-generativeai` Python library.

## 4. CLI Framework

*   **Decision**: `click`
*   **Rationale**: To create a CLI that orchestrates the `markitdown` conversion and the Gemini API call.
*   **Alternatives considered**:
    *   `argparse`

## 5. Testing Framework

*   **Decision**: `pytest`
*   **Rationale**: Standard for Python testing.
*   **Alternatives considered**:
    *   `unittest`

## 6. Performance, Constraints, and Scope

*   **Performance Goals**: Conversion time will depend on `markitdown` and the Gemini API response time.
*   **Constraints**: Requires a Gemini API key.
*   **Scope**: The MVP will convert a PDF, then process the resulting Markdown with Gemini for better readability.
