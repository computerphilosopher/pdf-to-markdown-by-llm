# Feature Spec: Dockerize for Easy Trial

- **Feature**: `002-docker`
- **Epic**: `experience`

## 1. Problem

Currently, trying out this project requires setting up a Python environment and installing dependencies. This can be a barrier for users who just want to quickly test the functionality.

## 2. Solution

We will create a Docker image for the application. This will allow users to run the CLI tool in a containerized environment without needing to install Python or any dependencies on their host machine.

### Dockerfile

- Use a suitable Python base image.
- Copy the source code into the image.
- Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Set up an entrypoint to run the CLI tool.

### User Experience

A user can build the Docker image and then run the tool by passing the PDF file and other arguments to the `docker run` command. We should also provide a simple script or instructions to make this process as easy as possible.

## 3. Plan

1.  Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root.
2.  Add `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from the image.
3.  Update `README.md` with instructions on how to build and run the application using Docker.
4.  (Optional) Create a shell script (e.g., `run-docker.sh`) to simplify the `docker run` command.

## 4. Out of Scope

-   Publishing the Docker image to a public registry.
-   Multi-stage Docker builds for production optimization. This is focused on a development/trial setup.
