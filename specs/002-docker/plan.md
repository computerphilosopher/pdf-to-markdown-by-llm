# Implementation Plan: Dockerize for Easy Trial

**Branch**: `002-docker` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-docker/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The project will be containerized using Docker to simplify the setup and trial process for new users. A `Dockerfile` will be created to build an image containing the Python application and its dependencies. The `README.md` will be updated with instructions on how to build and run the application using Docker.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3
**Primary Dependencies**: `click`, `markitdown`, `google-generativeai`
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Docker
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: Small CLI tool

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The project constitution is a template and does not contain specific gates. Therefore, this check passes by default.

└── test_post_processor.py
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See `data-model.md` and `quickstart.md`. No contracts are applicable for this feature.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root.
- Create a `.dockerignore` file in the project root.
- Update `README.md` with instructions from `quickstart.md`.
- (Optional) Create a `run-docker.sh` script to simplify the `docker run` command.

**Ordering Strategy**:
1.  Create `.dockerignore`.
2.  Create `Dockerfile`.
3.  Update `README.md`.
4.  (Optional) Create `run-docker.sh`.

**Estimated Output**: 3-4 tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A       | N/A        | N/A                                 |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
